Add warning / message when interface hits the boundary

Not so much a bug, as observation: in Stefan demo, boundary condition depends on the curvature. In a way it is implemented right now, interface_coarsening preserves interface curvature, however, interface smoothing and interface refinement - do not. It is probably too much work for the first release, however, taking advantage of the curvature information could lead to better performance of GRIT in simulations.

Unit tests for iterative solvers, test PCG

copy_attributes will crash with an exception if one forgets to set target coordinates on a "live" phase. It is rather hard as end-user to figure out what the error really is from this exception. Could we add some feature to help end-users, either by a gracefull fallback or some messaging/failure that make sense to the end-user?

Clean-up code review comments

Add solids wall to the liquid simulator

Create a meshing demo that converts a signed distance map into a mesh phase

Create a mathematical morphological opening/closing demo

	area_maximization
		Make high quality movie (high res quality mesh)


[Marek] Fix bug when a phase moves out and touches the boundary

[Marek] (demo_tutorial_contact) fix the simulation

[Marek] (demo_stefan) setup classic boundary condition, make sure runs full length
                      fix advection and move to a branch temporarily

[Marek] Move to github

[Marek] Boost bug in OpenTissue (reported by Ulrik Bonde 2. Maj 2017)
	OpenTissue/core/math/math_random.h uses BOOST_VERSION to detected if boost random should be used. However, using 1.61.0 on Linux, causes failures. First time is not a member of std (missing ctime include?), second details are not found (should be math::detail?). However this does not completely fix the bug???
	Error is not reproducable on Apple using Clang 8.X somehow the compiler acts like BOOST_VERSION is not defined.

[MAREK] Remove ear-production test from operation, and add an ear-removal batch at the end of algorithm.

[Marek] PCG fails if the x vector isn't initialized with 0s, it should accept the initial guess, it can significantly improve performance

[Marek] plot temperature field in stefan demo

[Marek] Switching use_ambient to false in stefan.cfg causes the program to crash.


[Marek] negative_curvature_flow
		Move asteroids demo to trunk and rename it

[KENNY] Make CUDA/CUSP optional

[MAREK+KENNY] Create a meta astroid core crystallisation demo spherical container of liquid, mixed elements of S & Fe, phase transition near solid walls that converts liquid into solid if S is low enough.

[KENNY] Create compression plates demo

[KENNY] Make documentation of how to set up assign/override functionality in cfg-files for multiphase demos

[KENNY] Added glue::make_boundary_of_phase functionality to help make it easier to work with boundaries in GLUE.

[KENNY] Improved glue::set_sub_range_target functionality to better guide end-user

[KENNY] Splitted AREA demo into separate demo

[MAREK] Make Debug Render: Introduce two parameters
	debug_render = on
	debug_render_level = 0     # Number determines the neighborhood side, number of times to call star recursively on the region that one is doing a mesh operation on
Inside do_optimization before an operation is done we call the function
       do_debug_rendering(….)
If debug_rendring is on. This function should make a “debug.svg” file of how the mesh looks like before the operation is tried out. The function takes the simplex_set and the simplex the operation is supposed to work on as argument as well as the mesh and debug render level. In the debug.svg file the mesh feature that is worked on should be highlighed (draw differently from the rest of the mesh). The idea is to overwrite the debug.svg file in for each operation and only render a small neighborhood of where the mesh operation is happening.

[KENNY] Fixed unit-tests to use bin-folder as working directory for running (and for putting the binaries).

[MAREK] Coarsening/Refinement are too aggressive as they can smooth out object boundaries

[KENNY] Change behaviour in ConfigFile throw exception when specified config file is not found… instead of returning false

[KENNY] Make a separation/sliding demo (maybe just read in displacement direction from cfg-file) and combine both demos into one called “conforming_interface_demo"?

[KENNY] Renamed library into GRIT from MoM2D

[KENNY] Update old documentation of how to use GRIT, GLUE, UTIL etc..
		[DONE] A) Update the key-note slides so they match new interfaces
		[DONE] B) Maybe drop the pdf-file with a step by step guide?
		[DONE] C) Update pictures in presentation
		[DONE] D) Write introduction to terminology of boundary, sub boundary, phase and interface, what is what?
		[DONE] E) Write a guide on how to use the glue sub ranges
		[DONE] F) Write an overview of how to use custom attributtes

[MAREK] Add angle-based criterion for MergeOperation

[MAREK] Replace the position assignment in vertex split with offsetting

[MAREK] Fixed the bug that caused spreading of sizing fields even when "use_sparse_edge_attributes" was on (new edge wasn't assigned new value in vertex split)

[MAREK] Reordering labels in config files causes the program to crash - fix this.

[MAREK] Double-check the no_ears() condition for edge collapse

[KENNY] Create cantilever beam demo

[TOBIAS] Make a GLUE tool for only partially setting of attribute values on vertex attributes

[MAREK+KENNY] Fix redundancy in svg code and that GRIT depenpends on GLUE/UTIL (GRIT should be stand-alone, so if svg drawing is needed in GRIT then we should move all svg stuff into GRIT and just let GLUE provide wrappers for dealing with the GLUE data types).

[KENNY] Add more failsafe tests to load_mesh_from_txt.h and load_mesh_from_gmsh.txt
	A) Ensure one-based indexing is used
	B) Ensure CCW order triangles
	C) Ensure no edges with more than two adjacent triangles
[KENNY] Fix bugs when loading unit_simple.txt and uniform_40x30.txt in unit_mom2d_test_data
