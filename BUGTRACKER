Add warning / message when interface hits the boundary

Not so much a bug, as observation: in Stefan demo, boundary condition depends on the curvature. In a way it is implemented right now, interface_coarsening preserves interface curvature, however, interface smoothing and interface refinement - do not. It is probably too much work for the first release, however, taking advantage of the curvature information could lead to better performance of GRIT in simulations.

Unit tests for iterative solvers, test PCG

copy_attributes will crash with an exception if one forgets to set target coordinates on a "live" phase. It is rather hard as end-user to figure out what the error really is from this exception. Could we add some feature to help end-users, either by a gracefull fallback or some messaging/failure that make sense to the end-user?

Clean-up code review comments

Add solids wall to the liquid simulator
